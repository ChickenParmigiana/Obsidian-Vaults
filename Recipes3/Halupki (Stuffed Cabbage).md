# Halupki (Stuffed Cabbage)

Halupki, also known as stuffed cabbage on the Russian/Ukranian side of my family, is a dish made of rice, beef, and pork encased in cabbage drizzled with a thin, sweet tomato sauce. My grandma Eugenia is 98 and she taught me how to make this comfort food classic. Every family has their own twist on this traditional dish. I hope you enjoy these with mashed potatoes just as we always do in my family!

    Place the cabbage in a stockpot with enough water to cover.
    
-   Step 2
    
    Add 1/4 teaspoon salt to the water and cabbage.
    
-   Step 3
    
    Bring water to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn cabbage every 2-3 minutes and remove leaves that separate from cabbage and place in a strainer to cool. Boil until all the leaves have cooked, about 15 minutes.
    
-   Step 4
    
    Reserve 12 oz. of cabbage water.
    
-   Step 5
    
    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    
-   Step 6
    
    Trim thick center vein off of bottom of each cabbage leaf.
    
-   Step 7
    
    In a large bowl thoroughly mix together, ground beef, ground pork, rice, chopped onion, fresh parsley, egg, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
    
-   Step 8
    
    Lightly pack a small amount of meat mixture and place in the center of the cabbage leaf.
    
-   Step 9
    
    Fold sides over the filling and start at the stem and roll the cabbage up until the meat is encased. Repeat with remaining leaves and filling.
    
-   Step 10
    
    Cut the leftover leaves into pieces and place into the bottom of a roasting pan.
    
-   Step 11
    
    Layer the stuffed cabbage rolls over the cut leaves.
    
-   Step 12
    
    In a bowl, mix the tomato sauce, reserved cabbage water, white vinegar, and white sugar.
    
-   Step 13
    
    Pour the tomato sauce mixture over the cabbage rolls.
    
-   Step 14
    
    Cover roasting pan with aluminum foil.
    
-   Step 15
    
    Bake in preheated oven until the ground beef mixture is no longer pink in the center, about 2 1/2 hours. Baste stuffed cabbage rolls every hour.
    

## Cook's Note:

I use Uncle Ben's ® Ready Rice, which is done in 90 seconds in the microwave, to cut down on prep time. Leftovers freeze well…that is, if you have any!

## Editor's Note:

For the 1 1/2 cups cooked rice in this recipe, cook 1/2 cup long grain white rice in 3/4 cup water (simmer, covered, for 20 minutes)--or make a larger batch and use leftovers for fried rice or rice pudding.
