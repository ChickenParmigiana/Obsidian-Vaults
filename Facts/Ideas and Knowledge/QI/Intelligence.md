## Enigma Code
Cracked first by the Poles in 1932, but the Germans changed it later in 30s.
The first one was a Polish mathematician called Maryan Rievski. Eisenhower estimated that the cracking of the Enigma code shortened the war by 2 years.

Alan Turing cracked the later variation of the Enigma code. He committed suicide after persecution of his sexuality by eating a poisoned apple, a la Socrates. Gordon Brown issued an apology on behalf of Britain many decades after.

Lorenz code - Turing and other scientist built Colossus, a huge supercomputer in order to crack this code used between Hitler and highest command.
This was given to the CIA and kept a national secret in UK
The code was broken by comparing different permutations with the names of German soldier's wives and dogs and such because they were constants.
