# Chef John's Classic Beef Stroganoff

This is a fairly lean version of beef stroganoff, as most recipes call for more cream. This is something you can easily adjust to your tastes. I like a little thicker version, with just enough sauce to coat the meat and noodles.

-   2 pounds beef chuck roast, cut into 1/2-inch thick strips
-   salt and pepper to taste
-   1 tablespoon butter
-   ½ medium onion, sliced or diced
-   8 ounces sliced mushrooms
-   2 cloves garlic, minced

## Directions

Instructions Checklist

-   Step 1
    
    Season beef generously with salt and pepper.
    
-   Step 2
    
    Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until nearly smoking. Stir in beef; cook, stirring constantly, for 6-7 minutes, until liquid evaporates and meat browns. Remove meat from the pan and set aside.
    
-   Step 3
    
    Stir butter, mushrooms and onions into the pan; cook and stir over medium heat until the vegetables are lightly browned. Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in flour; cook for 1-2 minutes until incorporated.
    
-   Step 4
    
    Stir in wine and 1 cup of stock, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits. Bring to a simmer, cook for 3-4 minutes, until the sauce thickens.
    
-   Step 5
    
    Return beef to the pan. Stir in remaining cup of stock; bring to a simmer and cook on low heat for about 1 hour with the lid on, until the beef is tender and the sauce is thick. Stir every 20 minutes.
    
-   Step 6
    
    Stir in creme fraiche. Stir in chives. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
    

## Serving Suggestion:

Serve over buttered noodles.

## Cook's Note:

If creme fraiche isn't available, you can substitute sour cream.
