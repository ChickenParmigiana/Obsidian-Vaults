# Chicken Stock (Chicken Bone Broth) 3 Ways!

## Ingredients for Chicken Stock (Chicken Bone Broth):

2 1/2 lbs of chicken bones (from [2 chickens)](https://natashaskitchen.com/how-to-cut-whole-chicken-video/), roasted\*  
1 Tbsp cider vinegar  
1 tsp salt  
1 medium onion, peeled and halved  
2 ribs/sticks of celery (cut into thirds, with leaves attached)  
2 medium carrots, peeled and halved  
2 smashed garlic cloves  
1 bay leaf, optional, but nice  
Filtered Water (stockpot: 16 cups, 6Qt Slow Cooker: 12 cups, Instant Pot: 10-11 cups)


## Roast the Bones (for all bone broth methods):

_If bones are from a cooked chicken or turkey, skip this roasting step. If using a whole raw chicken, watch this tutorial on [how to cut a whole chicken](https://natashaskitchen.com/how-to-cut-whole-chicken-video/)._ Place raw bones on a lined rimmed baking sheet and roast at 400˚F for 20 minutes. Transfer bones and any pan juices to your pot. Many recipes call for just raw bones which is ok, but roasting will really enhance their flavor.


## Stovetop Method (15 Hours of Slow Cooking):

The stovetop method is best if you have a huge stock pot and want to make a double batch, otherwise, it required the most babysitting and the temptation to check on it to make sure it wasn’t boiling like crazy was definitely there! The liquid does evaporate the most which is why more water is required for this method.

> Pro Cooking Tip: Bone broth is best when it is cooked until you can easily break a chicken bone in half with your hands. This means the amazing nutrients from the marrow are in your broth. You also know if you cooked it long enough when it thickens after refrigeration – which is totally normal. The broth turns to liquid again when it is heated.
