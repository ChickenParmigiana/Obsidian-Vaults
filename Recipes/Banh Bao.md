# Banh Bao

I'm a Vietnamese living in Indiana who had to find a recipe for one of my favorite Vietnamese snacks, banh bao. They are a variation on the Chinese cha siu bao (Chinese pork buns). I would like to thank Houston Wok for providing Ms. SkimmyJeans' moist filling recipe and Miss Adventure\[at\]home for a tasty bun recipe. Combined, this is my ultimate banh bao recipe.

## Ingredients

Filling:

-   1 pound ground pork
-   2 shallots, minced
-   2 tablespoons fish sauce
-   1 ½ tablespoons oyster sauce
-   1 tablespoon soy sauce

Dough:

-   4 ½ cups self-rising flour
-   1 ½ cups milk
-   ¾ cup white sugar
-   3 links Chinese sausages, sliced on the diagonal
-   4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and quartered
-   waxed paper

## Directions

Instructions Checklist

-   Step 1
    
    Mix pork, shallots, fish sauce, oyster sauce, and soy sauce together in a large bowl. Let mixture marinate in the refrigerator, about 30 minutes.
    
-   Step 2
    
    Combine self-rising flour, milk, and sugar in another large bowl; knead until dough is smooth and no longer sticky. Cover dough with cheesecloth; let rest, about 5 minutes.
    
-   Step 3
    
    Divide dough into 18 balls. Roll out each ball into a circle with a rolling pin on a floured work surface. Place a spoonful of the pork mixture in the center; top with 2 sausage slices and an egg quarter. Gather the edges of each circle together like a coin purse; twist and pinch to seal the bun.
    
-   Step 4
    
    Cut waxed paper into eighteen 2-inch squares. Place each bun on a waxed paper square. Arrange 1 inch apart in a steamer; cover with lid.
    
-   Step 5
    
    Steam buns until puffed up, about 30 minutes.
    

## Cook's Notes:

If dough seems too moist in step 2, add more flour until it no longer sticks to your fingers.

## Tips

I'm still trying to find a means of making the buns white. I usually add a tablespoon of white vinegar to the steaming water. However, I don't really see any difference. Others have advised using baking powder. I may try that next time.
