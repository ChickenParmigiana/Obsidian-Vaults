# Piri Piri Chicken

Chicken is marinated in a spicy piri piri pepper sauce, then grilled for this simple but flavorful African-inspired recipe. I like to serve this with a cool yogurt sauce and fonio pilaf.

## Ingredients

Ingredient Checklist

-   10 African bird's eye chile peppers
-   1 bunch cilantro
-   2 cloves garlic, minced
-   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-   2 teaspoons white vinegar
-   2 limes, juiced
-   1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
-   1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper, or to taste
-   1 chicken breast, cut in half
-   2 chicken leg quarters with skin

## Directions

Instructions Checklist

-   Step 1
    
    Use rubber gloves to mince the chiles and place into a mixing bowl. Add cilantro, garlic, vegetable oil, vinegar, lime juice, salt, and black pepper. Mix piri piri sauce well.
    
-   Step 2
    
    Place chicken breasts and legs into a resealable plastic bag. Pour in piri piri sauce, seal the bag, and shake gently to completely cover chicken. Put the bag in the refrigerator to marinate at least 4 hours.
    
-   Step 3
    
    Remove bag from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking to allow chicken to come to room temperature.
    
-   Step 4
    
    Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
    
-   Step 5
    
    Remove chicken from the bag; discard bag and cilantro. Cook chicken on the preheated grill, rotating as necessary to cook evenly, until juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 25 minutes.
