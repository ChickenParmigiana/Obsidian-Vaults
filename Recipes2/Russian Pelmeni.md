## Ingredients

Dough:

-   1 egg
-   1 teaspoon vegetable oil
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   ¾ cup warm water
-   3 cups all-purpose flour
-   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

Filling:

-   18 ounces ground beef
-   1 small onion, chopped
-   1 ½ tablespoons ice-cold water
-   1 tablespoon coarse salt
-   freshly ground pepper to taste

## Directions

Instructions Checklist

-   Step 1
    
    Combine egg, vegetable oil, and salt in a measuring cup; add enough water to fill to 1 cup. Pour into a bowl, add 3 cups flour, and knead into a smooth, elastic dough. Cover with a kitchen towel and rest for 30 minutes.
    
-   Step 2
    
    Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour.
    
-   Step 3
    
    Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix filling thoroughly by hand or using a fork.
    
-   Step 4
    
    Roll out a portion of the dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface and cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or a wine glass. Keep the rest of the dough covered with a towel to avoid drying out. Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of filling on one side of the dough circle. Fold dough over and seal the edges using fingers, forming a crescent. Join the ends and pinch them together. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking together.
    
-   Step 5
    
    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer and drop small batches of frozen pelmeni into simmering water. Cook and stir until the meat is cooked and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking for an additional 5 minutes. Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon.
    

## Cook's Notes:

Instead of ground beef you can also use a mixture of half ground pork and half ground beef. Sometimes we use ground turkey for the filling. If you're not a fan of raw onion, saute onion in butter first for 5 to 7 minutes on medium heat.

## Tips

You can also make the dough in a Kitchen Aid(R), just turn it off once the dough is forming a ball.

## Tips

The meat filling can also be made by processing filling ingredients through a meat grinder but do not use a blender or food processor, unless you have a special setting for meat.

## Tips

In Russia, people often use a pelmeni mold for forming pelmeni. If you have a pelmeni mold, roll out portions of the dough very thinly on a slightly floured surface. You should end up with a circle slightly bigger than the mold. Place rolled out dough onto the mold with the floured side down (the "sticky" side should be facing you). Place a little ball of filling (about 1 teaspoon) into every cell. Cover with another dough layer and sprinkle with flour on top. Roll with a rolling pin over the top, until pelmeni start "popping out" from the mold. Gather the remains of the dough, add a little bit of new dough to it, and roll out again, repeating the process until all the dough is used up.

## Tips

Pelmeni can also be fried in a skillet. Melt butter or bacon grease in a skillet and saute frozen pelmeni until they are soft and the meat is cooked through, just like pierogi. Pelmeni are usually served with sour cream or vinegar.

## Tips

In our house we usually double this recipe and fold about 200 pieces. Leftover pelmeni can easily be frozen for later use.
