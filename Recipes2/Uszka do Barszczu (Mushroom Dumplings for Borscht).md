## Ingredients

Filling:

-   3 ½ ounces dried wild mushrooms
-   2 tablespoons butter
-   1 large onion, chopped
-   salt and ground black pepper to taste
-   2 tablespoons bread crumbs, or as needed (Optional)

Dough:

-   8 cups all-purpose flour
-   1 cup hot milk
-   1 egg yolk

## Directions

Instructions Checklist

-   Step 1
    
    Place dried mushrooms in a small saucepan and cover with hot water; bring to a boil. Cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and chop into small pieces.
    
-   Step 2
    
    Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in mushrooms; continue cooking until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Add breadcrumbs if filling seems too wet.
    
-   Step 3
    
    Combine flour, hot milk, and egg yolk in a large bowl, stirring quickly with a fork until a soft and smooth dough forms.
    
-   Step 4
    
    Roll dough out on a lightly-floured surface. Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares. Place a teaspoon of filling in the center of each square. Fold the dough over the filling to form a triangle and pinch edges to seal. Bring the bottom corners together and pinch together.
    
-   Step 5
    
    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook dumplings in batches until they float to the surface of the water, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate with a slotted spoon.
    

## Cook's Note:

Add more milk in step 3 if dough appears too stiff.
