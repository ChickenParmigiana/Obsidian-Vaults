# Russian Burgers (Kotlety)

These Russian kotlety are very easy and versatile. I usually add whatever's on hand to give the burgers a little something extra: a little oregano, thyme, herbes de Provence, etc... or go with some paprika and a little ancho chile powder. These are just some suggestions and can be altered to taste or completely left out.

## Ingredients

Ingredient Checklist

-   1 pound ground pork
-   1 small onion, grated
-   1 clove garlic, minced
-   1 large egg, lightly beaten
-   salt and ground black pepper to taste
-   1 cup water, or more as needed
-   1 cup bread crumbs, or as needed
-   3 tablespoons vegetable oil, or to taste

## Directions

Instructions Checklist

-   Step 1
    
    Combine pork, onion, garlic, and egg in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Add water a little at a time, stirring until pork mixture absorbs it and reaches the consistency of sour cream.
    
-   Step 2
    
    Pour bread crumbs onto a plate. Scoop up medium-sized balls of the pork mixture with a tablespoon and drop into the bread crumbs; flip to coat both sides.
    
-   Step 3
    
    Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry patties, in batches if necessary, until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes per side.
    

## Cook's Note:

If needed, you can add some bread crumbs to the pork mixture to help it thicken up or to help with the stickiness.
