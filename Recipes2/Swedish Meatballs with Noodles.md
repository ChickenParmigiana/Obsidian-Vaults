-   ¾ cup milk, divided
-   1 large egg, slightly beaten
-   1 clove garlic, minced
-   1 ½ teaspoons salt
-   ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
-   ⅛ teaspoon ground allspice
-   2 tablespoons salted butter
-   3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

-   1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles
-   1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

## Directions

Instructions Checklist

-   Step 1
    
    Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
    
-   Step 2
    
    Combine ground beef, pork, bread crumbs, 1/2 cup milk, egg, garlic, salt, pepper, and allspice in a large bowl; mix until just combined. Use a rounded 1-tablespoon measure to form mixture into meatballs. Place meatballs on a baking sheet.
    
-   Step 3
    
    Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through.
    
-   Step 4
    
    While the meatballs are baking, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add flour. Cook, whisking constantly, for about 1 minute, being careful not to burn or brown the flour. Gradually whisk in the remaining milk and broth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce has thickened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Add Worcestershire sauce to taste and remove from the heat.
    
-   Step 5
    
    Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes.
    
-   Step 6
    
    Drain any grease from the meatballs. Add meatballs to sauce; toss gently to coat. Turn on lowest heat to warm. Add milk or water to thin sauce if too thick.
    
-   Step 7
    
    Drain egg noodles and serve immediately topped with sauce, meatballs, and parsley.
