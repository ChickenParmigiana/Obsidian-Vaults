## Ingredients

Ingredient Checklist

-   1 pound spaghetti
-   6 tablespoons olive oil
-   2 cloves garlic, minced
-   2 teaspoons ground black pepper
-   1 ¾ cups grated Pecorino Romano cheese

## Directions

Instructions Checklist

-   Step 1
    
    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Scoop out some of the cooking water and reserve. Drain spaghetti.
    
-   Step 2
    
    Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and pepper; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add spaghetti and Pecorino Romano cheese. Ladle in 1/2 cup of reserved cooking water; stir until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Add more cooking water until sauce coats spaghetti, about 1 minute more.
    

## Cook's Notes:

Substitute butter for the olive oil if preferred. For a thicker or thinner sauce, adjust how much pasta water you add. If you add too much water, add some more cheese.

## Tips

I have added other ingredients depending on my main dish to enhance flavors (like pancetta); I always experiment when creating food.
