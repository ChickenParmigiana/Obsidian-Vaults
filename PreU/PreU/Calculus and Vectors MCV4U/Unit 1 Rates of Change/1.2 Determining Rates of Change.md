## Find the slope of a line given following:
1. The line goes through the points $(3,-5)$ and $(6,8)$.
	$$m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$
	$$\frac{8-(-5)}{6-3}$$
	$$\frac{13}{3}$$

2. The line has the equation $y=4x-5$

	The general equation of a line is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the value of the slope.\
	From this equation, we can see that the slope of this line is simply $4$
	
3. The line that is parallel to the line $y=2x+9$
	If lines are parallel, the slope is the same. Just like the other question, the slope is $m$.
	So, the slope of the line is also $2$.
	
The average rate of change of a function with respect to $x$ between $A(a,f(a))$ and $B(b,f(b))$ is
$$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$
This is the same formula as the slope formula. The average rate of change is actually just the slope of the function from point A to B.
The slope of the line between points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is found with $$m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$

## Try to find the average rate of change in the population of Ontario from 2006 to 2016 and use it to predict the population for 2041. What are the coordinates of points A and B

The points (coming from a table) are $(2006,12.661.566)$ and $(2016,13 982 984)$ 

1. To find the slope, or average rate of change, between points A and B, use $m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$
		$$m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$
			$$m=\frac{13982984-12661566}{2016-2006}$$
				$$m=\frac{1321418}{10}$$
					$$m=132141.8$$
						So, the average rate of change over these 10 years of the population in Ontario is $132141.8$ people per year.\
						 

2. Predict the population in 2041.\
	There are 25 years between 2041 and 2016.
		$$25(132141.8)+13982984=17286529$$
		
## A secant line is a line that intersects a curve at 2 points.

1. Determine the average rate of change of $y$ over the interval $-2,1$

| x   | y   |
| --- | --- |
| -2  | 0   |
| -1  | -1  |
| 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 3   |
| 2   | 8   |
	
When $x=-2$, $y=0$
	When $x=1,y=3$\
		So, the points are $-2,0$ and $1,3$\
			The average rate of change is $$m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$
				$$\frac{3-0}{1-(-2)}$$
					$$\frac{3}{3}=1$$
					
## To Find instantaneous rate of change along a curve, we use a tangent line.
To calculate the instantaneous rate of change at the tangent point, we must calculate the slope of the tangent line.

So, how do we do this, when we only have one point?

### The Secant Method
This method only estimates what the slope of the actual tangent line might be. This method uses the average rate of change between two points to estimate the slope of the line. The slope of the tangent line is the rate of change at that particular point.

Procedure
	Basically, just pick points really close to the tangent point and find its slope. This is a fast and simple method if you don't really care about the exact answer or dislike your employer.

For example, estimate the instantaneous rate of change at the point $(5,23)$ on the curve $y=x^2-2$
1.	First, we need to select a series of points very close to $5,23$
	Since $x$ is $5$, we can use numbers such as $5.1, 5.01, 5.001$ for $x$.
	
	This gives us the following table of values:
	
	| $x$   | $x^2-2$|
	| ----- | ----------------------- |
	| 5     | $y=5^2-2=23$ |
	| 5.1   | $y=5.1^2-2=24.01$ |
	| 5.01  | $y=5.01^2-2=23.1001$ |
	| 5.001 | $y=5.001^2-2=23.010001$ |
2. Now we can calculate for average rate of change
 
	| $(x_1,y_1)$ | $(x_2,y_2)$       | Average rate of change $m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$ |
	| ----------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
	| $5,23$      | $5.1,24.01$       | $m=\frac{24.01-23}{5.1-5}=10.1$                     |
	| $5,23$      | $5.01,23.1001$    | $m=\frac{23.1001-23}{5.01-5}=10.01$                 |
	| $5,23$      | $5.001,23.010001$ | $m=\frac{23.010001-23}{5.001-5}=10.001$                                                    |

3. If we keep doing this, we can see that the values are approaching the value $10$\
    We can say that the slope of the tangent line is $10$.

Try to estimate the instantaneous rate of change on the curve $y=4x^3-7x^2$ at the point $(6,612)$.

1. Our points
 
| x     | $y=4x^3-7x^2$                    |
| ----- | -------------------------------- |
| 6     | $4(6)^3-7(6)^2=612$              |
| 6.1   | $4(6.1)^3-7(6.1)^2=647.454$      |
| 6.01  | $4(6.01)^3-7(6.01)^2=615.486504$ |
| 6.001 | $4(6.001)^3-7(6.001)^2=612$      |

2. Average rate of change table

| $x_1,y_1$ | $(x_2,y_2)$          | Average rate of change                     |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| $(6,612)$ | $(6.1,647.454)$      | $m=\frac{647.454-612}{6.1-6}=354.54$       |
| $(6,612)$ | $(6.01,647.454)$     | $m=\frac{647.486504-612}{6.01-6}=348.6504$ |
| $(6,612)$ | $(6.001,612.348065)$ | $m=\frac{647.348065-612}{6.001-6}=348.065$ |
                        
3. The instantaneous rate of change on the curve $y=4x^3-7x^2$ at the point $(6,612)$ is approximately $348$.

## Conclusion
### Average Rate of Change
* Refers to the rate of change of a function over an interva
* Calculated as regular slope between two points
* Use the two endpoints to calculate slope
### Instantaneous Rate of Change
* Refers to the rate of change at a specific point
* Need to find slope between given point and a point very close to that point (There are other methods, this is the simplest method for approximation)
