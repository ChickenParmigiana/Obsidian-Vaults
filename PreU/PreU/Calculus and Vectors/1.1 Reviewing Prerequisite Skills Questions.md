# 1.1 Reviewing Prerequisite Skills
## Practice Questions

[[Calculus and Vectors]]

1. Find the equation of a line with slope $+5$ and passing through the point 					$(-2,4)$
	
	* $m=5$ point $(2,4)$\
	* The **General Equation** of a line
	* $y=m(x-x_1)+y_1$\
		*	$y=5(x-(-2))+4$\
			*	$y=5(x+2)+4$\
				*	$y=5x+10+4$\
					*	$y=5x+14$
		
			The equation of the line is $y=5x+14$

2. Factor.
	* Inspection
		* $x^2+7x+12$
			*  Two numbers that add to 7 and multiply to 12 are +3 and +4.
				*  The Solution is $(x+3)(x+4)$
		* $x^2-7x+10$
			* Two numbers that add to -7 and multiply to 10 are -5 and -2.
				* The Solution is $(x-5)(x-2)$
		* $x^2-5x-24$
			* Two numbers that add to -5 and multiply to -24 are -8 and 3.
				* The solution is $(x-8)(x+3)$
		* $2x^2+9x-5$
			* Find two numbers that add to 9 and multiply to 10. 
			* Instead of multiplying out to -5, **keep in mind** there is $2x^2$
			* The numbers are -1 and 10. 
				* = $2x^2-1x+10x-5$
				* =$x(2x-1)+5(2x-1)$
					* Get the brackets to be the same, in this case $(2x-1)$.
						* The solution is $(2x^2-1)$
	* Difference of Squares
		* $49x^2-36y^2$
			* The sqrt of $49x^2$ is $7x$.
			* The sqrt of $36y^2$ is $6y$.
				* The solution is $(7x+6y)(7x-6y)$
				* **This is for subtracted squares only** 
	* Perfect Square
		* $64x^2-80x+25$
			* The sqrt of $64x^2$ is $8x$
			* The sqrt of 25 is 5
			* Check the middle term - $2$ x $8x$ x $5$ = $80x$
				* The solution is $64x^2-80x+25=(8x-5)^2$

3. Find the roots.
	* $y=x^2+2x-24$
		* $6*(-4)=(-24)$
		* $6+(-4)=2$
			* $y=(x+6)(x-4)$
	
	* $y=3x^2-5x-2$
		* There are two possible ways to solve this question, by Factoring or by the Quadratic Formula. 
		* Method 1: Factoring
			* Two numbers that multiply to (-6) and add to (-5): 1 and (-6)
			* = $3x^2+1x-6x-2$
				* = $(3x^2+1x)-6x-2$
					* = $[x(3x^2+1)]*2(3x+1)$
						* $(3x+1)(x-2)$
							* This means the roots are 2 and $-\frac{1}{3}$
		* Method 2: Quadratic Formula - after picking the lock for a while, why not try the master key?
			* This is the Quadratic Formula: $$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$
			* $$a=3;b=-5;c=2x$$
				* $$\frac{-(-5)\pm\sqrt{(-5)^2-4(3)(-2)}}{2(3)}$$
				* $$5\pm\sqrt \frac{25+24}{6}$$
				* $$\frac{5\pm7}{6}$$
					* Roots are either $2$ or $-\frac{1}{3}$
	
	* $y=2x^2+4x-1$
		* This function is not factorable. Use quadratic formula.
		~~~
		I should find out if there is a simpler way of determining whether or not a function is factorable
		~~~
		* $$a=2;b=4;c=-1$$
		* $$\frac{-4\pm\sqrt{(-4)^2-4(2)(-1)}}{2(2)} = \frac{-4\pm24}{4}$$
			* $x=0.225$ or $-2.225$
		
	* $y=x^3+2x^2-5x-6$
		* Polynomial division, here is a helpful video, thanks to our boy, Sal.
