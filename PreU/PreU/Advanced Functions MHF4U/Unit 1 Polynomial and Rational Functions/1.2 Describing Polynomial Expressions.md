**A one variable polynomial expression** is an expression that is made up of only one variable (that is, one letter of the alphabet)

The polynomial expression $7x^2+x-3$\
is a one variable expression because the only variable in the expression is $x$

A **term** is a number or variable or product of.

A polynomial expression in factored form is an expression written as a product of its factors.
For example, the **factored form** of the expression $x^2+x-6$ is $(x+3)(x-2)$.

 ## Summary

A one variable polynomial expression can be in standard form or factored form

A one variable polynomial expression is a series (sum) of terms where each term is the product of a constant and a variable with an exponent that is a positive whole number when written in standard form.

1. ### Determine whether or not each following expression is a polynomial expression or not
$\sqrt{2x-5}$\
Since the exponent is a fraction and not a whole number, this is not a polynomial expression. $\sqrt{2x-5}$ = $(2x-5)^\frac{1}{2}$.

$(7x+9)^2(1-x)$\
This is a polynomial because all the terms inside the brackets have exponents that are whole numbers. If we expand this expression we get a series of terms with exponents that are positive whole numbers.

$x-2x^{-3}$\
This is not a polynomial because the term $2x^{-3}$ has a negative exponent.

$\frac{x}{x+7}$\
This is not a polynomial because it is
1. Rational
2. Involves dividing by a variable
3. There is a variable in the denominator
4. It can be written with a negative exponent $\frac{x}{x+7}=x(x+7)^{-1}$

## Degrees

The degree of a polynomial expression is determined by the highest exponent in the expression. 

$x+9$ has the degree 1, $x^1+9$. No exponent means degree of 1
