## Culminating Task: Making the World a Better Place

Part of the evaluation of this course will be in the form of a culminating activity, worth 15% of your final course work.

In this activity you will explore connections between the concepts learned in this course and environmental issues. Specifically, you will create a mathematical model and visual representations to provide evidence to convince investors that a way to improve an environmental issue of your choice would be a worthy project in which to invest.

#### Overview

You have decided that you are going to make a pitch to the hosts of a reality TV show where entrepreneurs request funding for projects, or products, designed to reduce the damage to the environment caused by human activity.

Your pitch must combine a compelling reason why your initiative should be supported, with evidence that justifies the need for action. You will research and collect secondary data, use the data to create graphical and algebraic models, make predictions based on your algebraic model and create a visual presentation using the media/ platform of your choice (PowerPoint, WordPress, Prezi, Weebly, iMovie, Show Me, Blogger, Tumblr, YouTube, etc.). The function used to create your algebraic model must be one of the types of functions (polynomial of degree 3 or higher, exponential, logarithmic or trigonometric) covered in this course.

#### Step 1

Identify and describe an environmental issue and a proposed way to reduce impact and improve outcomes. The proposal could be as simple as a campaign to convince people to change daily habits that are harmful to the environment or as complex as developing a new environmentally friendly product or process.

#### Step 2

Research secondary data from a reliable source and create a mathematical model to predict outcomes if no action to reduce harmful effects is taken.

#### Step 3
Create algebraic and graphic representations of your model and provide a brief, but convincing, description of the benefits of your proposal.
